/**
 * GRAPH CREATOR
 * Graph creator with breadth first search.
 * 
 * Implementation: Create a program which can create graphs (we are using weighted edge, directed graphs), 
 * and it can search for a path in the graph using breadth-first search. Use an adjacency table for the graph, 
 * which can be printed out. (You may assume that no more than 20 vertices will be in the table.)
 * 
 * (1) Add Vertex: Enter a label for a vertex. Add it to the graph.
 * (2) Add Edge: Enter two node names and a weight (number). Add an edge between them, 
 *      from the first node to the second node. (You would need to create another edge to go both directions.)
 * (3) Remove Vertex: Enter a vertex label and remove it from the graph. Remove all edges to that vertex.
 * (4) Remove Edge: Enter two vertex labels, and remove an edge between them.
 * (5) Find Path: Enter two vertex labels. Starting at the first label, use a breadth-first search to find a path between 
 * the first vertex and the last vertex. Return the shortest path (and total) if it exists, or return that no path exists.
